# Projects

Here, I talk about about some of the technical projects and tools that I have made. The general theme of these projects/tools are related to the domains that I am very passionate about, namely web development, data science and the Linux operating system. Almost all of the stuff that I documented here was made so that I could have a more hands-on experience with the technology (like a language, library or framework) to learn it or just to have fun because I was feeling bored.

I also love to document about the stuff where I take other awesome and amazing projects to create a setup that I like to use or incorporate at home. Like the project where I used a self-hosted media server to create my own Netflix (so to speak) or the time when I have snatched my father's old Windows Server testing environment to create my own Homelab Linux server.
