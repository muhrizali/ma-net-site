# Books

I love to read books. From a young age I really wanted to be someone who loves to hangout with books more than people (I can attest I have come a long way in that direction). I don't know what but this escape, being an another being, living in totally different conditions and sometimes, in totally absurd or strange situations, is thrilling to me. 

I also love to read and learn from the experiences of the authors, who in most cases are, apparently people with more wisdom and have lived to see more than me.
