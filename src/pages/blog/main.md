# Blog

This is where I write about things that I want to talk about to someone (but didn't have anyone at the moment) or simply the things that interests me. The topics I write about usually do not have a specific theme or genre. I should say that currently I am also finding the direction myself (or I may have found that already). If you were to ask me, I would say that I like to write about the stuff that are or 'Philosophical', 'Austere', 'Wise' and 'Creative' nature. Or I try to.
